/**
 A generic class that allows for decoupled communication between components through a fire-and-react mechanism.

 `Trigger` can be used to create a flexible event system where the firing component doesn't need to know about the reacting component(s).

 Example:
 ```swift
 // create a trigger
 let trigger = Trigger<Int>()

 // set a reaction to the trigger
 trigger.setReaction { [weak self] value in
   // react to the received value
 }

 // somewhere later, fire the trigger with a value
 trigger.fire(with: 2)
 ```
