  /// Dispatches received values to the specified queue, with an option for immediate execution if already on the target queue.
  ///
  /// This method optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary queue switching when the publisher
  /// is already operating on the target queue. It provides control over whether to always dispatch
  /// asynchronously or allow immediate execution in same-queue scenarios.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```swift
  /// somePublisher
  ///   .receive(on: .main, alwaysAsync: false)
  ///   .sink { value in
  ///     // update UI...
  ///   }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - queue: The queue to which received values should be dispatched.
  ///   - alwaysAsync: If `true`, received values will always be dispatched asynchronously, even if already on the target queue.
  ///                  If `false`, received values will be dispatched immediately if already on the target queue.
  /// - Returns: A publisher.
